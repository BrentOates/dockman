**Warning: This software is currently in alpha. Expect bugs and breaking changes.**

## Overview

Dockman is a tool designed to simplify the management of Docker Compose files, particularly for homelab environments. It
provides a straightforward way to edit, track, and back up your compose configurations.

## WIP Features

* **Easy Editing with LSP Support:** Integrated Language Server Protocol (LSP) for enhanced editing features like
  autocompletion and syntax validation.
* **Git Tracking:** Built-in Git support to track changes in your compose files, providing version history and easy
  rollbacks.
* **Painless Backup/Restore:** Simple, reliable commands for backing up and restoring your entire Docker Compose setup
  using git.

## Feedback

This project is in early stages, so any and all feedback is a huge help. If you spot a bug, have an idea for a
feature, or just want to share your thoughts, please open an issue.

I'd especially love to hear what you think about a couple of things:

* The File and Folder Structure
  * Right now, all the files are just stored in a flat structure. 
  * It works, but if you have a better idea for how to organize everything, please open an issue and let me know!

* The UI
  * I'm not a UI expert, in fact I hate it. The current interface is mostly built with Material-UI and Gemini. 
  * If you have ideas on how to make it look better or easier to use, I'm all ears. Feel free to open an issue with your suggestions.


## Usage
